# "Crawled - Currently Not Indexed" Explanation

## 📋 Issue Summary

**Type:** Info (not an error)  
**Message:** "Crawled - currently not indexed"  
**Status:** ✅ Expected behavior for internal files

### Affected URLs:
1. `/_next/static/chunks/1c7e9a669b124069.css?dpl=...` - Next.js CSS chunk file
2. `/favicon.ico?favicon.0b3bf435.ico` - Favicon file

---

## ✅ Why This is Correct

These are **internal Next.js files** that Google shouldn't index:

1. **`/_next/static/`** - Next.js build artifacts (CSS, JS chunks)
   - Generated during build
   - Not meant for direct access or indexing
   - Should be excluded from crawling

2. **`/favicon.ico`** - Browser icon file
   - Used by browsers, not search engines
   - Not meant to be indexed
   - Should be excluded from crawling

**Google correctly recognizes these shouldn't be indexed** - that's why they show as "crawled but not indexed."

---

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Updated `robots.txt` to Disallow:
- `/_next/` - All Next.js internal files
- `/favicon.ico` - Favicon file

This prevents Google from wasting crawl budget on these files.

### Before:
```typescript
disallow: ['/api/', '/admin/']
```

### After:
```typescript
disallow: [
  '/api/',
  '/admin/',
  '/_next/',
  '/favicon.ico',
]
```

---

## 📊 What This Means

### Current Status:
- ✅ Google crawls these files (to understand site structure)
- ✅ Google correctly doesn't index them (they're not content)
- ✅ This is expected and correct behavior

### After Fix:
- ✅ Google will stop crawling these files (saves crawl budget)
- ✅ No more "crawled but not indexed" messages for these files
- ✅ More crawl budget available for actual content pages

---

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **Immediate**: robots.txt updated
- **1-3 days**: Google re-crawls robots.txt
- **3-7 days**: Google stops crawling `/_next/` and `/favicon.ico`
- **1-2 weeks**: Messages clear from Search Console

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Check robots.txt is Updated

Visit: `https://www.homesteadwestlasvegas.com/robots.txt`

Should show:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /api/
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /_next/
Disallow: /favicon.ico
```

### 2. Test with Google's robots.txt Tester

1. Go to Google Search Console
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **robots.txt Tester**
3. Test URLs:
   - `/_next/static/chunks/...` → Should show "Blocked"
   - `/favicon.ico` → Should show "Blocked"

### 3. Monitor Search Console

- Check **Coverage** report
- "Crawled - currently not indexed" messages should decrease
- No new messages for `/_next/` or `/favicon.ico` files

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Status:** ✅ Fixed - robots.txt updated

- Internal Next.js files now properly excluded
- Google will stop wasting crawl budget on these files
- More efficient crawling for actual content pages
- Messages will clear after Google re-crawls robots.txt

**The "crawled but not indexed" messages were informational** - Google was correctly not indexing these files. Now we've told Google not to crawl them at all, which is more efficient.
