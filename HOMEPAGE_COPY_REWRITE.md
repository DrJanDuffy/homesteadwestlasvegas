Why Most Buyers Miss Out on the Best Lots

### Body Copy
Here's what happens when you buy new construction alone:

The builder's sales rep works for the builder. Their job is to sell you a house at full price. They won't tell you about better lots coming next month. They won't negotiate upgrades. They won't share insider pricing.

You show up on opening day. The corner lots are gone. The premium floor plans are sold out. You're left choosing from what's left.

You pay asking price. No negotiation. No leverage. The builder holds all the cards.

What if you had someone on your side? Someone with early access to new phases? Someone who could negotiate upgrades and incentives?

That's the difference between buying alone and working with an independent agent who has VIP builder partnerships.

### Question 1
**Do I pay you anything?**
No. The builder pays my commission. You get expert representation at zero cost to you.

### Question 2
**Can I just go to the builder directly?**
You can. But you'll work with the builder's sales rep. They work for the builder, not you. They won't negotiate. They won't share early access. You'll pay full price and choose from what's left.

### Question 3
**What if I'm buying from out of state?**
I work with relocating buyers regularly. Video tours. Virtual consultations. Document signing via DocuSign. I can coordinate everything remotely. You'll have local representation even if you're 2,000 miles away.

### Question 4
**How does early access actually work?**
I get notified when new Homestead West phases are about to release. Usually 48 hours before public. I send you available lots. Floor plans. Pricing. You can secure your lot before anyone else sees it.

### Question 5
**What if I'm not ready to buy for 6 months?**
That's fine. Register in my VIP program now. You'll get early notifications. You can watch the market. When you're ready, you'll already have priority access.

### Question 6
**Do you only work with Homestead West?**
No. I have VIP partnerships with multiple builders across Las Vegas. Homestead West is one community I specialize in. I can help you with other new construction communities too.
